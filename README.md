# TheDataDig - CYB102 Group Capstone Project

## Overview
TheDataDig is a cybersecurity project from the **CYB102** course at CodePath, simulating a real-world **incident response** and **analysis** scenario. The project involved leveraging industry-standard tools to analyze a dataset of our choice. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with cybersecurity analysis, threat detection, and response protocols.

## Project Details

### Objective
The goal of this project was to perform a **full security analysis** of a **real-world dataset**, following an **incident-response playbook**. Our team analyzed the **CICIDS2017 dataset**, which contains **network traffic captures** and other related files, simulating cybersecurity incidents. Using these datasets, we applied a structured playbook to detect, respond to, and mitigate potential threats.

### Dataset
- **CICIDS2017 Dataset**: This dataset contains **network traffic captures** and other related files, simulating real-world network incidents. The data includes details about traffic, network protocols, and attack patterns which are essential for threat event dataset analysis.
  
### Key Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: For analyzing network traffic captures and identifying potential threats in packet-level data.
- **Splunk**: Used for log file analysis and correlation of data to detect security incidents.
- **Incident Response Playbook**: The structured approach followed to identify the problem, assess impact, and determine remediation strategies.

## Methodology

1. **Incident Identification & Triage**:  
   We applied the **incident-response playbook** to identify suspicious patterns in the dataset, focusing on key indicators like **network anomalies** and **unusual traffic patterns**.

2. **Data Analysis**:  
   Using **Wireshark** and **Splunk**, we inspected packet captures and correlated logs to identify critical insights.

3. **Impact Assessment**:  
   Analyzed the impact of the detected threats on the network and systems, performed a risk assessment, and prioritized response actions based on severity.

4. **Remediation Recommendations**:  
   Based on the findings, we proposed remediation actions such as updating security configurations, patching vulnerable systems, and improving network monitoring practices to prevent similar incidents.

5. **Presentation**:  
   The final project was presented at **Demo Day**, where we shared our findings, analysis, and response strategies with the class. This presentation included visuals from our case management system and demonstrated our use of playbooks, tools, and threat intelligence.

## Key Results
- **Incident Identification**: Identified key **security threats** and anomalies in network traffic, highlighting potential vulnerabilities.
- **Response Playbook Application**: Successfully applied a **structured response plan** to mitigate identified threats, improving our teamâ€™s incident handling process.
- **Documentation & Reporting**: Created comprehensive reports and visual aids to document findings and recommended actions, ensuring clarity and actionable next steps for real-world application.

## Project Milestones
- **Milestone 1**: Selected dataset and response playbook, began initial analysis.
- **Milestone 2**: Conducted deeper analysis using industry tools (Wireshark, Splunk), followed playbook to respond to the incident.
- **Final Presentation**: Presented findings at Demo Day, with a focus on impact analysis, remediation strategies, and lessons learned.
